# The Ultimate Account Hub & Admin Dashboard Prompt

Use the following detailed prompt to build or re-create a professional-grade Account Hub and Admin Dashboard for a trading platform integrated with the Deriv API (via WebSockets).

---

## **Prompt Objective**

Build two high-performance, visually stunning modules: an **Account Hub** for traders and a **comprehensive Admin Dashboard** for platform management. The design must be "Premium" (dark mode, glassmorphism, vibrant gradients, fluid animations) and the code must be modular and type-safe.

## **Module 1: Account Hub**

A centralized dashboard where traders manage their profile, stats, and history.

### **Core Features:**

    - Display avatar, username (editable), and Account ID with a "Copy" badge.
    - Show "Verified" status and Account Type (Real/Demo).
    - Dynamic background gradients based on currency/account type (e.g., Emerald for Real-USD, Slate for Demo).
2.  **Stat Grid**:
    - Quick-glance cards for Total Accounts, Real/Demo counts, and active trading status.
3.  **Tabbed Interface**:
    - **User Details**: List of all linked Deriv accounts with real-time balance fetching and a "Portfolio Total" summary.
    - **Transaction Statement**: A chronological list of all deposits, withdrawals, and trades.
    - **Profit Reports**: Visual breakdown of daily/weekly performance.
    - **Performance Journey**: A graphical representation of account growth over time using Recharts.

    - A powerful searchable/filterable table of all platform users.
    - Ability to see "New Today" users and "Blocked" users.

## **Technical & Aesthetic Requirements**

- **Tech Stack**: Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons, Recharts, Radix UI (Tabs, Dialogs, etc.).
- **Aesthetics**:
    - **Backgrounds**: Hex `#050505` or deep slate with subtle glows.
    - **Cards**: Glassomorphic style with `backdrop-blur-xl`, `border-white/5`, and `bg-white/[0.02]`.
    - **Typography**: Bold black-style headers with tight tracking (`tracking-tighter`).
    - **Feedback**: Use `lucide-react` icons for every primary action and state.
- **Performance**: Fast refresh intervals (5-15s) for live stats with loading skeletons or "alive" pulse effects.
